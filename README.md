# House-Price-Prediction
# **About Project**

This project is about analysing the house prices in King County, Washington State, USA. This different features of house like number of bedrooms, bathrooms, latitude and longitude can affect the price of house. Regression models work well with this kind of dataset. Thus we use Gradient boosting Regressor model for the purpose of prediction of House prices.


# ***What is the software requirement?***

Python 3.7 or above

# ***Datasets:*** Following csv files

kc_house_data.csv


# ***What are the required python packages?***

Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
scikit-learn


# ***Approach used for Houseprice prediction***

We use *Gradient Boosting Regression algorithm*.
Gradient Boosting algorithm is used to generate an ensemble model by combining the weak learners or weak predictive models. Gradient boosting algorithm can be used to train models for both regression and classification problem. Gradient Boosting Regression algorithm is used to fit the model which predicts the continuous value.
This estimator builds an additive model in a forward stage-wise fashion; it allows for the optimization of arbitrary differentiable loss functions. In each stage a regression tree is fit on the negative gradient of the given loss function.
Thus,it is well suited for the purpose of predictions.


# ***Results:***
The accuracy of gradient boosting regressor algorithm : 0.9094721522827934 
while accuracy for Linear Regression model : 0.7320342760357638
